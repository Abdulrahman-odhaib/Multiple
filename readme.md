# Domain Reconnaissance and Analysis Tool

This Bash script facilitates reconnaissance and analysis tasks for a specified domain, aiding in information gathering and assessment. The tool operates in three primary steps:

1. **Subdomain Enumeration:** It gathers subdomains using various reconnaissance tools such as Subfinder, Sublist3r, and Amass. The results are consolidated and organized for further analysis.

2. **IP Resolution:** The script resolves subdomains to their corresponding IP addresses and saves the results for further examination.

3. **Live Domain Verification:** It verifies the existence of live domains, opens them in a web browser for inspection, and captures screenshots for visual analysis.

The tool streamlines the reconnaissance process, providing valuable insights into a domain's infrastructure and facilitating informed decision-making.
